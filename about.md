**Okay, I'll admit it: I'm a lazy programmer. I like things to be simple and easy. I don't want to remember many things at a time.**

#### **That's why I always try to automate as many things as possible.**

(That's why I'm moving [my personal blog](http://quyennt.com) from WP to this blog using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/))

I'm working for [Agency Revolution](http://www.agencyrevolution.com/) as a product engineer where we are building an Automation Marketing system, targeting insurance industry.

From my job, I help developing our product folowing micro-service architecture, from designing architecture, doing DevOps to actually coding the business. What we are doing is awesome.

I also passionate about Data Science. Without any background in Mathematics or Statistics, I spend almost all my spare time learning and practicing Machine Learning skills, mainly in R.
