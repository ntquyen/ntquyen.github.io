I love programming. When I first thought about my career at the age of
16, I decided to become a programmer, and no second thought since
then. Time flied and things changed had driven me off programming more
than once, but I always found out and went back to it.

So far, I have programmed in Java (mostly android), PHP for 2
years. And then NodeJS for another 2 years until recently Golang for
few months now. I also program in R for my Data Science projects on
Coursera and helping my wife with her reporting in Excel at work.

I like to explore new technologies and methodologies. From my current
job, I help in developing and maintaining a system of hundreds of
microservices in different programming languages (NodeJS and Golang)
from scratch. Our cluster stack is Kubernetes & Docker & CoreOS. I'm
also a devops guy who build and maintain CI with Jenkins and
Ansible, sometimes bash script. 

I like to learn new skills to boost productivity. That's why I really
like doing devops, writing scripts to automate things.  I have changed
my editor from Sublime Text to Emacs and feel awesome about it. I was
a fan of Sublime Text for a long time, but now I love Emacs even more!

As mentioned above, I also passionate about Data Science. Without any
background in Mathematics or Statistics, I spent almost all my spare
time learning and practicing Machine Learning skills, mainly in
R. Please checkout my [linkedin](https://vn.linkedin.com/in/nguyen-quyen-29856252) for all MOOC courses I have passed.
