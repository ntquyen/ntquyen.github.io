A wonderful year has come to an end, a new year's coming. It is time to pause and take a look back.


As I paused a moment, I was like, wow, can't believe that there've been so many changes since last year! And two biggest changes that came to me were that I got a girlfriend, and I got a new job.




Yes, I fell in love. 27 years old and she's my first girlfriend (You might be laughing at me :-)) This new relationship makes me happier than ever. We engaged just a month ago, and we will get married this year. So exciting to be a husband!




And yes, I got a new job. This totally changed all my plans last year. I don't work in PHP projects anymore. Instead, I'm working on NodeJS, learning to be full-stack engineer.




Take a deep breath looking at the 2014's resolution to see what I have done... Of course, I failed most of them! I stopped PHP dev. I didn't complete any online course, I didn't write blog so often, and I didn't travel much as planned.




Instead, during last 8 months, I learned a new language, Javascript/NodeJS; I also learned about Agile development, CI-CD, micro-services, Docker, and DevOps. Most of all, I'm learning to not only focus on technical, but also on building products. Truly, what I have learned from my new job is so valuable and I'm proud of it.




However, the truth that I failed is undeniable. Time flies and things change, opportunities come and go, don't wait for anybody. You can never know whether you're right or wrong the moment you made your decision, even long after that. Eventually, the only things you'd regret are the things that you didn't do.




I do regret about things I didn't do, but not much. It's simply because I didn't have enough time to do it all, and things I left behind are the ones less important for me. Another reason is I'm not a good time organizer, but I'm trying to get there.




New Year's Eve was over, been busy helping repair my parents' house so the post took me longer than usual to complete. HAPPY NEW YEAR to my family, to my love, and to you.
