Today’s good day, and it marks the official opening of my blog site!

This blog is the place where I can share my knowledges, skills experiences. And by sharing, I could achieve two important things: self-improvement and reputation. And besides, I think it might be useful for who sharing the same interests with me. It’s not big, but I will try my best so that it will not be useless.

And what is this blog all about? It’s all about my interests that listed below



	
  * **Programming**. Programming is my favorite topic. Because it is the thing I do best (compare to other stuffs that I can do), and it is the thing I want to be among the bests.

	
  * **Technologies**. Have you ever saw Iron Man? Have you ever imagine that you just talk to machines, ask them to do the tasks and bring the output for you? Your productivity will be push up to a thousand percent or even more. That’s my dream.

	
  * **Self development**.


That’s all. I hope that through this playground, you could know me better!
