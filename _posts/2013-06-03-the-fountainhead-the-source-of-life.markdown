"Thousands of years ago, the first man discovered how to make fire. He was probably burned at the stake that he taught his brothers to light. He was considered an evildoer who had dealt with a demon mankind dreaded. But thereafter, men had fire to keep them warm, to cook their food, to light their caves. He had give them a gift they had not conceived and he had lifted darkness off the earth. Centuries later, the first man discovered the wheel. He was probably torn under the rack he had taught his brother to build. He was considered a transgressor who ventured into forbidden territory. But thereafter, men could travel pass any horizon. He had left them a gift they had not conceived and he had opened the roads of the world."

"**Throughout the centuries, there were man who took first step down new roads armed with nothing but their own vision.** Their goals differed, but they all had this in common, that the step was first, the road new, the vision un-borrowed, and the response the received  - hatred. The great creators - the thinkers, the artist, the scientists, the inventors - stood alone against the men of their time. Every great new thought was opposed. Every great new invention was denounced. The first motor was considered foolish. The first airplane was considered impossible. The power loom was considered vicious. Anesthesia was considered sinful. But the men of un-borrowed vision went ahead. They fought, they suffered and the paid. But they won."

"**No creators was prompted by a desire to serve his brothers**, for his brothers rejected the gift he offered and that gift destroyed the slothful routines of their lives. **His truth was his only motive. His own truth, and his own work to achieve in his own way**. A symphony, a book, an engine, a philosophy, an airplane or building - that was his goal and hist life. Not those who heard, read, operated, believed, flew or inhabited the thing he has created. The creation, not its users. The creation, not the benefits others derived from it. **The creation which gave form to his truth. He held his truth above all things and against all men**."

"His vision, his strength, his courage came from his own spirit. A man spirit, however, is his **self**. That entity which is his consciousness. **To think, to feel, to judge, to act are the functions of the ego.**"

"The creators were not selfless. It is the whole secret of their powers - that it was self-sufficient, self-motivated, self-generated. A first cause, a fount of energy, a life force, a Prime Mover. **The creator served nothing and to no one. He lived for himself.**"

"**And only by living for himself, he was able to achieve things which are the glory of mankind. Such is the nature of achievement.**"

"Man cannot survive except through his mind. He comes on earth unarmed. His brain was his only weapon. Man has no claws, no fangs, no horns, no great strength of muscle. To obtain food, he must plant or hunt. To plant, he needs a process of thought. To hunt, he needs weapon, and to make weapon - a process of thought. **From this simplest necessity to the highest religious abstraction, from the wheel to the skyscraper, everything we are and everything we have comes from a single attribute of man - the function of his reasoning mind.**"

"But the mind is an attribute of the individual. There is no such thing as a collective brain. There is no such thing as a collective thought. An agreement reached by one group of men is only a compromise of an average drawn upon many individual thoughts. It is a secondary consequence. The primary act - the process of reason - must be proceeded by each man alone. No man can use his lung to breath for another man. No man can use his brain to think for another.  All the functions of body and spirit are private. They cannot be shared or transferred."

"**The egotist in the absolute sense is not the man who sacrifies others.** He is the man who stands above the needs of using others in any manner. He does not function through them. He is not concerned with them in any primary matter. Not in his aim, not in his motive, not in his thinking, not in his desire, not in his source of energy. **He does not exist for any other men, and he asks no other men to exist for him.** This is the only form of brotherhood and mutual respect possible between men."

"Degrees of ability vary, but the basic principle remains the same: the degree of a man's independence, initiative and his personal love for his work determines his talent as a worker and his worth as a man**. Independence is the only gauge of human virtue and value.**"

**"The first right on earth is the right of the ego. Man's first duty is to himself.** His moral law is never to place his prime goal within the persons of others. His moral obligation is to do what he wishes, provided his wish does not depend _primarily_ upon other men. "
