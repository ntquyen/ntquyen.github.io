First of all, I must say that I’m sorry, not to you but to myself, about not writing for along time. There are many excuses, but I’m not noting them in here. After all, I am responsible for what I do or don’t.

Having had a great lunar new year at home, and inspired by [Matthew Setter](http://www.matthewsetter.com/10-new-years-resolutions-every-web-developer-should-make-for-2013/) (Although it’s from last year, there’re things that never get old), I decide to write down my goals for 2014.

## **PHP Development**


[![php-icon](http://quyennt.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/download.jpeg)](http://quyennt.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/download.jpeg)

Since 1.5 year, my everyday work has been totally on PHP development. So this year, as the goal to become a senior PHP developer, I’m gonna cover as most as I can in this subject and stay on top of every releases.

More concretely, there’s things I listed below:



	
  * Server & Deployment: In 2 months (Feb and Mar), I will create a separated, independent environment from where I would be able to build and deploy my applications. I will learn about:

	
    * Deploy PHP application with Vagrant, Chef

	
    * Apache Ant, Phing

	
    * Continuous Integration with PHPCI.




	
  * Coding standards: I will learn PSR-0, PSR-1, PSR-2, PSR-4. (2 weeks)

	
  * Design Patterns in PHP: Factory, Singleton, Strategy, MVC and its relatives (HMVC, MVVM) (2 weeks)

	
  * PHP debugger: I will learn XDebug, PHPDBG (2 weeks)

	
  * Dependency Management: I will learn how to use Composer and Pear. (2 weeks)

	
  * Security: OWASP, password hashing, sanitization. (2 months)

	
  * Testing: unit test, functional test and integration test with testing tools like PHPUnit, Selenium… (1 month)




## **Big Data**

I have learn Data Science for more than 6 months via Coursera and have little experience. But for many reasons, this subject excites me so much that I’m considering it as my long term goal. So this year, I will focus in:



	
  * Apache Hadoop, MapReduce pattern


	
  * Join Kaggle competition, finish the entry level assignment: Titanic

	
  * Finish at least one online course on the subject (Data Analysis, Coursera)




## **Blogging**


I will write at least one article per month.

I will be more proactive in forums like StackOverflow, Quora... by keep posting questions and answers.


## Taking a break


[![travel](http://quyennt.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/travel.jpg)](http://quyennt.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/travel.jpg)

I will  keep up doing exercises 3 times per week, traveling at least 2 times this year. Ha Giang, northern Vietnam is on top of the list.

That's all. There is pretty much to do but I think I can manage that. How about you?
