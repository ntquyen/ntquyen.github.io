When I was at high school, I hated writing. I never got a good mark in essays. Writing essays had always been a painful work for me. Every essays were about poems, stories, fictions… and I didn't really like most of them. I've never been a poetry guy, ever. How could you be good at writing when you always have to write about something you don't like?

As I went to college, started writing some letters for the girl I love. I spent hours for each letter, but there was no pain, but full of my feelings for the girl.

Sometimes, when an idea suddenly appeared in my mind, I felt that I want to write it down, so that I could make it clearer.

And sometimes, when I read a nice quote, or an article that excited me, I also felt that I want to write down my personal thought, so that I could understand more about myself.

And sometimes, when I experienced something new from works, from researches, writing it down on the pages helped me understand it well enough to answer questions. Because, even if you understand it well, without writing it down, there would be points that you accepted uncritically.

That kind of feeling never left me. That's why I decided to blog, to put what's in my mind on the pages, to make sure about what I've already known, and of course, so that YOU could get to know me better.

However, writing isn't easy. It is proved to be a hard work. Trying to write something that makes sense is difficult. It could take you hours, even days, and a lot of effort to publish an article. It is the process of organizing your thought. That means thinking, writing, and restructuring, and repeating that process over and over again. Sometimes, when you got stuck, you deleted everything and started over. It must take a huge effort to make writing one of your frequent activities. And it is the only way to help you improve your writing skill.

Of course, I myself haven't succeeded it yet. To me, writing's never get easier. To be honest, it took me a week to publish this article (yeah.. frustrated.). But every night at home, I thought about it, tried to answer the question, deep down, why I want to write?
