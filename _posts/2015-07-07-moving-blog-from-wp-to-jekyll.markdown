[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is all I'm looking for for a personal blog. Here's why:

- Dead simple: With Jekyll, I can edit my blog using my favorite editor: Sublime Text! And It takes only one command to deploy (`git push`) to production. I don't have to care about setup VM, setup database and deploy code anymore.
- Lightweight: Just static files: HTML, CSS and markdowns and nothing else!
- Fast: again, just static files.
